# CSS-in-TS research analysis - ⚠️ Working Draft

> _Last update: **Jan 2021**_

This document contains a thorough analysis of all the current **CSS-in-JS** solutions. The baseline reference we'll use for comparison is a **CSS Modules** approach. We're using **Next.js** as a SSR framework for building resources. Last important aspect is type-safety with full **TypeScript** support.

## Motivation

The CSS language and CSS Modules approach have some limitations especially if you want to have solid and type-safe code. Some of these limitations have alterative solutions, others are just being "annoying" and "less ideal":

1. **Styles cannot be co-located with components**  
  This can be frustrating when authoring many small components, but it's not a deal breaker. However, the experience of moving back-and-forth between the component and the .css file, searching for a given class name, and not being able to easily _"go to style definition"_ is a huge productivity bottleneck.

2. **Styling pseudos and media queries requires selector duplication**  
  Another frustrating fact at some point is the need to duplicate your class name when defining __pseudo classes and elements__, or __media queries__. You can overcome these limitations using a CSS preprocessor like __SASS, LESS or Stylus__, which all support the `&` parent selector, enabling __contextual styling__.

3. **Styles usage is disconnected from their definition**  
  You get no IntelliSense with CSS Modules, of what styles/classes are defined in the `.module.css` files, making **copy-paste** a required tool, lowering the DX. It also makes __refactoring very cumbersome__, because of the lack of safety.

4. **Using type-safe design tokens is a nightmare**  
  Any design tokens, defined in JS/TS cannot be directly used in CSS. There are 2 workarounds for this issue, neither of them being elegant:
   - We could inject them as [CSS Variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties), but we still don't get any IntelliSense or type-safety
   - We could use **inline styles**, which is less performant and also introduces another way to write styles (camelCase vs. kebab-case), while also splitting the styling in 2 different places.

<br />

## Goals

There are specific goals we're looking for:

- 🥇 SSR support and easy integration with Next.js
- 🥇 full TypeScript support
- 🥇 great DX with code completion & syntax highlight
- 🥈 light-weight
- 🥉 low learning curve and intuitive API

<br />

Getting even more specific, we wanted to experience the usage of various CSS-in-JS solutions regarding:

- defining __global styles__
- using __media queries__ & __pseudo classes__
- __dynamic styles__ based on component `props` (aka. component variants), or from user input
- __bundle size__ impact

<br />

## Disclaimer

This analysis is intended to be **objective** and **unopinionated**:
- I don't work on any of these solutions, and have no intention or motivation of _promoting_ or _trashing_ either of them.  
- I have no prior experience with any CSS-in-JS solution, so I'm __not biased__ towards any of them. I've equally used all the solutions analyzed here.

<br />

👎 **What you WON'T FIND here?**  
- which solution is _"the best"_, or _"the fastest"_, as I'll not add any subjective grading, or performance metrics
- what solution should you pick for your next project, because I have no idea what your project is and what your goals are

<br />

👍 **What you WILL FIND here?**  
- an overview of (almost) all CSS-in-JS solutions available at this date (see _last update_ on top) that we've tried to integrate into a **Next.js v10 + TypeScript** empty project, with __minimal effort__;
- a limited set of **quantitative metrics** that allowed me to evaluate these solutions, which might help you as well;
- an additional list of **qualitative personal observations**, which might be either minor details or deal-breakers when choosing a particular solution.

The libraries are not presented in any particular order. If you're interested in a brief __history of CSS-in-JS__, you should checkout the [Past, Present, and Future of CSS-in-JS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75kmPj_iUOA) talk by Max Stoiber.

**LEGEND**:

✅ - full & out-of-the-box support  
🟠 - partial/limited support (or not ideal)  
❌ - lack of support  

1. **Co-location**: ability to define styles within the same file as the component.  
  You can also extract the styles into a separate file and import them, but the other way around does not apply.
2. **DX**: Developer eXperience which includes:
    - syntax highlighting
    - code-completion for CSS properties and values
3. **`` tag` ` ``**: support for defining __styles as strings__
    - uses ES Tagged Templates and `kebab-case` for property names, just like plain CSS syntax
    - enables easier migration from plain CSS to CSS-in-JS, because you don't have to re-write your styles
    - requires additional code editor plugins for syntax highlight and code completion
    - usually implies slightly larger bundles and slower performance, because the strings must be parsed before
4. **`{ }`**: support for defining __styles as objects__
    - uses plain JacaScript Objects and `camelCase` for property names
    - more suitable for new projects, when you don't need to migrate existing CSS
    - without TS support, you won't get code completion
5. **TS**: TypeScript support for library API, either built-in, or via `@types` package, which should include
    - typings for the library API
    - Style Object typings (in case the library supports the object syntax)
    - `Props` generics (if needed)
6. **`&` ctx**: support for __contextual styles__, allowing to easily define __pseudo classes/elements__ and __media queries__ without the need to repeat yourself
    - can either support the SASS/LESS/Stylus `&` parent selector
    - or provide some specific API or syntax to achieve this
7. **Nesting**: support for __arbitrary nested rules/selectors__
    - this feature allows for great flexibility, which is required in some specific use-cases
    - but it also introduces too many ways of defining styles, which might cause chaos in very restrictive use-cases, or when you want to enforce good-practices, consistency, scalability and maintainability
8. **Theme**: built-in support for Theming or managing design tokens/system
9. **`.css`**: support for extracting and serving the styles as native `.css` files
    - this increases FCP metric because the document is parsed faster, and .css files can be fetched in parallel with other resources
    - it also reduces bundle size, because you don't need runtime styles evaluation, to inject the styles
    - dynamic styling could potentially increase the generated file, because all style combinations must be pre-generated at built time
    - more suitable for less dynamic solutions (ie: e-commerce)
10. **`style` tag**: support for serving the styles as injected `<style>` tags in the document's `<head>`
    - makes dynamic styling super easy
    - incurs longer load
    - more suited for highly dynamic and interactive applications
11. **Atomic**: ability to generate atomic css classes and increasing reusability, reducing style duplication
    - this generates a separate CSS class for each CSS property
    - it's a bit more difficult to debug/inspect when dealing with many class names applied
    - you'll get larger HTML files, because each element will contain a large number of CSS classes applied
    - theoretically [atomic CSS-in-JS](https://sebastienlorber.com/atomic-css-in-js) reduces the scaling factor of your styles, [Facebook is doing it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JZHodNR184) as well
    - it's debatable if the styles size reduction, is greater than the html size increase (what is the final delta)
12. **`className`**: the API returns a string which you have to add to your component/element
    - similar how you would normally style React components, so it's easy to adopt because you don't have to learn a new approach
    - you'll probably have to use string concatenation, or interpolation, to combine styles
13. **`styled`**: the API creates a wrapper (styled) component which includes the `className`(s)
    - you'll have to learn a new way to define styles
    - it also introduces a bit of indiretion when figuring out what native element gets rendered
    - first introduced and popularized by Styled Components
14. **`css` prop**: allows passing styles using a special css prop, similar to inline styles
    - this is usually an additional feature for styled components, but it can also work separately
    - it's a nice and flexible ergonomic API
    - first introduced and popularized by Emotion v10
15. **Learn**: a subjective opinion regarding the learning curve (NOTE: you should really evaluate this on your own !!!)
16. **Page delta**: the total page size difference in kB (transferred gzipped / uncompressed resources) compared to __CSS Modules__, for the entire index page production build
    - keep in mind that this includes an almost __empty page__, with only a couple of components
    - this is great for evaluating the minimal overhead, but does NOT offer any insight on the scaling factor: logarithmic, linear, or exponential
    - the values for the __runtime library__ are taken from Chrome Devtools Network tab, [Transferred over network vs Resource size](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/network/reference#uncompressed)

<br />

### Overall observations

The following observations apply for all solutions (with minor pointed exceptions) and are explained here.

<br />

✅ **Code splitting**  
Components used only in a specific route will only be bundled for that route. This is something that Next.js performs out-of-the-box.

<br />

✅ **Global styles**  
All solutions offer a way to define global styles, some with a separate API.  
   - **JSS** has a convoluted API for this, which requires an additional plugin, which we didn't figure out how to implement

<br />

✅ **SSR**  
All solutions are able to be Server-Side Rendered by Next.js.

<br />

✅ **Vendor prefixes**  
All solutions add vendor specific prefixes out-of-the-box.
   - **JSS** requires an additional plugin for this

<br />

✅ **Unique class names**  
All solutions generate unique class names, like CSS Modules do.

<br />

✅ **No inline styles**  
None of the solutions generate inline styles, which is an older approach, used by pioneers like Radium & Glamor. The approach is less performant than CSS classes, so it's [not recommended](https://reactjs.org/docs/dom-elements.html#style). It also implies using JS event handlers to trigger pseudo classes, as inline styles do not support them. Apparently, all modern solutions nowadays moved away from this approach.

<br />

✅ **Full CSS support**  
All solutions support most CSS properties that you would need: **pseudo classes & elements**, **media queries**, **keyframes** are the ones that we tested.

<br />

🟠 **Increased [FCP](https://web.dev/fcp/)(First Contentful Paint)**  
For solutions that don't support `.css` file extraction, **SSRed** styles are added as `<style>` tags in the `<head>`, which will result in higher FCP than using regular CSS, because `.css` files can and will be loaded in paralel to other resources, while big `<style>` content will be sent and parsed along with the HTML, increasing parsing time. 
- solutions that perform `.css` file extraction don't have this problem (this includes **CSS Modules** and **Treat**)

<br />

🟠 **Dead code removal**  
Most solution say they remove unused code/styles. This is only **half-true**. Unused code is indeed more difficult to accumulate, especially of you compare it to large `.css` files as we used to write a century ago. But when compared to CSS Modules, the differencies are not that big. Any solution that offers the option to write **selectors** or **nested styles** will bundle unused styles. Even solutions that don't offer this option, have the same problem.

Basically, what you get is code removal when you delete the component, because the styles are colocated.

<br />

🟠 **Debugging / Inspecting**  
Most solutions inject the `<style>` tag in the DOM in `DEVELOPMENT`, which is a slower approach, but enables style inspecting using browser dev tools. But when building for `PRODUCTION`, they use [`CSSStyleSheet.insertRule()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CSSStyleSheet/insertRule) to inject the styles directly into the CSSOM, which is a way faster approach, but you cannot inspect the styles.
   - **JSS** and **Stitches** use `insertRule()` in dev mode as well, so you cannot see what gets injected
   - **TypeStyle** does NOT use `insertRule()`, not even in production

<br />

❌ **No component deduping**  
If the same component is imported by 2 different routes, it will be send twice to the client. This is surely a limitation of the bundler/build system, in our case Next.js, and __not related to the CSS-in-JS solution__.

In Next.js, code-splitting works at the route level, bundling all components required for a specific route, but according to their [official blog](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-9-2#improved-code-splitting-strategy) and [web.dev](https://web.dev/granular-chunking-nextjs/) if a component is used in __more than 50%__ of the pages, it should be included in the `commons` bundle. However, in our example, we have 2 pages, each of them importing the `Button` component, and it's included in each page bundle, not in the `commons` bundle. Since the code required for styling is bundled with the component, this limitation will impact the styles as well, so it's worth keeping this in mind.

<br />

<br />

### CSS Modules

This is a well established, mature and solid approach. Without a doubt, it's a great improvement over BEM, SMACCS, or any other methodology to structure and organize your CSS, especially in component-based applications.

### Styled JSX

Very simple solution, doesn't have a dedicated website for documentation, everything is on Github. It's not popular, but it is the built-in solution in Next.js.

Version: __`3.4`__ | Maintained by [Vercel](https://github.com/vercel) | Launched in __2017__ | [View Docs](https://github.com/vercel/styled-jsx) | ... [back to Overview](#overview)

<br />

- ✅ __Styles/Component co-location__
- 🟠 __Context-aware code completion__:  to get syntax highlighting & code completion, an editor extension is required
- 🟠 __TypeScript support__:  `@types` can be additionaly installed, but the API is too minimal to require TS
- ❌ __No Atomic CSS__
- ❌ __No Theming support__

- __Styles definition method(s)__
  - ✅ Tagged Templates
  - ❌ Style Objects

- __Styles nesting__
  - ❌ Contextual styles
  - ✅ Abitrary nesting

- __Styles apply method(s)__
  - ✅ `className`
  - ❌ `styled` component
  - ❌ `css` prop

- __Styles output__
  - ❌ `.css` file extraction
  - ✅ `<style>` tag injection

- 📉 __Low Learning curve__: because the API is minimal and very simple

<br />

#### Other benefits

- 😌 out-of-the-box support with Next.js
- 👍 for user input styles, it generates a new class name for each change, but it removes the old one
- 👌 it generates slightly smaller styles than the default CSS modules settings, probably due to shorter unique class names (you can see this in the difference between the runtime library size __3.9 kB__ and the page size increase, which I'd expect to be larger, but instead it's __3.6 kB__, this being tiny code base, so this delta might scale)

<br />

#### Worth mentioning observations

- 😏 unlike CSS modules, we can target HTML `elements` also, and it generates unique class names for them (not sure if it's a good practice, though)
- 🤓 we'll need to optimize our styles by [splitting static & dynamic styles](https://github.com/vercel/styled-jsx#dynamic-styles), to avoid rendering duplicated styles
- 🤨 unique class names are added to elements, even if we don't target them in our style definition, resulting in un-needed slight html pollution (optimizing this is cumbersome, and it's _a lot of work for little benefit_)
- 😕 it will bundle any defined styles, regardless if they are used or not, just like plain CSS
- 😢 there's no support for __contextual styles__, so defining __pseudo classes__ or __media queries__ has the same downsides as plain CSS, requiring selectors/class names duplication (a [SASS plugin](https://github.com/vercel/styled-jsx#css-preprocessing-via-plugins) is required to get this feature)

<br />

#### Conclusions

Overall, we felt like writting plain CSS, with the added benefit of being able to define the styles along with the component, so we __don't need an additional `.css` file__. Indeed, this is the philosophy of the library: supporting CSS syntax inside the component file. We can __use any JS/TS constants of functions__ with string interpolation. Working with __dynamic styles is pretty easy__ because it's plain JavaScript in the end. We get all these benefits at a very low price, with a pretty __small bundle overhead__.

The downsides are the overall experience of writting plain CSS. __Without nesting support__ pseudo classes/elements and media queries getting pretty cumbersome to manage.

### Styled Components

For sure one of the most popular and mature solutions, with good documentation. It uses Tagged Templates to defines styles by default, but can use objects as well. It also popularized the `styled` components approach, which creates a new component along with the defined styles.

<br />

- ✅ __Styles/Component co-location__

  - ❌ `.css` file extraction
  - ✅ `<style>` tag injection

- 📈 __Higher Learning curve__: we have to learn the API, get used to using the `styled` wrapper components, and basically get used to a new way to manage our styles

<br />

#### Worth mentioning observations

- 🧐 the `css` prop is mentioned in the API docs, but there are no usage examples
- 🤓 we need to split static & dynamic styles, otherwise it will render duplicate output
- 😕 bundles nested styles even if they are not used in component
- 😵 we can mix Tagged Templates with Styled Objects, which could lead to convoluted and different syntax for each approach (kebab vs camel, EOL character, quotes, interpolation, etc)
- 🥴 some more complex syntax appears to be a bit cumbersome to get right (mixing animations with Styled Objects, dynamic styles based on `Props` variations, etc)
- 🤫 for user input styles, it generates a new class name for each update, but it does NOT remove the old ones, appending indefinitely to the DOM

<br />

#### Conclusions

Styled components offers a novel approach to styling components using the `styled` method which creates a new component including the defined styles. You don't feel like writting CSS, so coming from CSS Modules we'll have to learn a new, more programatic way, to define styles. Because it allows both `string` and `object` syntax, it's a pretty flexibile solution both for migrating our existing styles, and for starting a project from scratch. Also, the maintainers did a pretty good job keeping up with most of the innovations in this field.

However before adopting it, we must be aware that it comes with a certain cost for our bundle size.

### Emotion

Probably the most comprehensive, complete and sofisticated solution. Detailed documentation, fully built with TypeScript, looks very mature, rich in features and well maintained.

Version: __`11.1`__ | Maintained by [Mitchell Hamilton](https://twitter.com/mitchellhamiltn) & [others](https://opencollective.com/emotion#category-ABOUT) | Launched in __2017__ | [View Docs](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction) | ... [back to Overview](#overview)

<br />

- ✅ __Styles/Component co-location__
- ✅ __TypeScript support__
- ✅ __Built-in Theming support__
- ✅ __Context-aware code completion__: for using the `styled` components approach, an additional editor plugin is required
- ❌ __No Atomic CSS__

- __Styles definition method(s)__
  - ✅ Tagged Templates
  - ✅ Style Objects

- __Styles nesting__
  - ✅ Contextual styles
  - ✅ Abitrary nesting

- __Styles apply method(s)__
  - ❌ `className`
  - ✅ `styled` component
  - ✅ `css` prop

- __Styles output__
  - ❌ `.css` file extraction
  - ✅ `<style>` tag injection  

- 📉 __Low Learning curve__: when using the `css` prop, which is the primary approach, the API is pretty straightforward (the `styled` approach however incurs the same learning curve for [Styled Components](#styled-components))

<br />

#### Other benefits

- 😎 the `css` prop offers great ergonomics during development, however it seems to be a newer approach, based on [React 17 new `jsx` transform](https://reactjs.org/blog/2020/09/22/introducing-the-new-jsx-transform.html), and [configuring](https://emotion.sh/docs/css-prop) it is not trivial, differs on your setup, and implies some boilerplate (which should change soon and become easier)

<br />

#### Worth mentioning observations

- 😕 bundles nested styles even if they are not used in component
- 🤫 for user input styles, it generates a new class name for each update, but it does NOT remove the old ones, appending indefinitely to the DOM
- 😑 using `styled` approach will add `3 kB` to our bundle, because it's imported from a separate package
- 🤔 don't know how to split static and dynamic styles, resulting in highly polluted duplicated styles in head for component variants (same applies to `css` prop & `styled` components)

<br />

#### Conclusions

Overall Emotion looks to be a very solid and flexible approach. The novel `css` prop approach offers great ergonomics for developers. Working with dynamic styles and TypeScript is pretty easy and intuitive. Supporting both `strings` and `objects` when defining styles, it can be easily used both when migrating from plain CSS, or starting from scratch. The bundle overhead is not negligible, but definitely much smaller than other solutions, especially if you consider the rich set of features that it offers.

It seems it doesn't have a dedicated focus on performance, but more on Developer eXperience. It looks like a perfect "well-rounded" solution.

### Treat

Modern solution with great TypeScript integration and no runtime overhead. It's pretty minimal in its features, straightforward and opinionated. Everything is processed at compile time, and it generates static CSS files, similar to CSS Modules, Linaria, or Astroturf.

Version: __`1.6`__ | Maintained by [Seek OSS](https://github.com/seek-oss/) | Launched in __2019__ | [View Docs](https://seek-oss.github.io/treat/) | ... [back to Overview](#overview)

<br />

- ✅ __TypeScript support__
- ✅ __Built-in Theming support__
- ✅ __Context-aware code completion__
- ❌ __No Styles/Component co-location__: styles must be placed in an external `.treat.ts` file
- ❌ __No Atomic CSS__

- __Styles definition method(s)__
  - ❌ Tagged Templates
  - ✅ Style Objects

- __Styles nesting__
  - ✅ Contextual styles
  - ❌ Abitrary nesting

- __Styles apply method(s)__
  - ✅ `className`
  - ❌ `styled` component
  - ❌ `css` prop

- __Styles output__
  - ✅ `.css` file extraction
  - ❌ `<style>` tag injection

- 📉 __Low Learning curve__: coming from CSS Modules it feels like home, the additional API required for variants is pretty straightforward and easy to learn

<br />

#### Other benefits

- 👮 forbids __nested arbitrary selectors__ (ie: `& > span`), which might be seen as a downside, when it's actually discourages bad-practices like __specificity wars__

<br />

#### Worth mentioning observations

- 😕 bundles styles even if they are not used in component
- 😥 it doesn't handle dynamic styles: you can use built-in `variants` based on predefined types, or __inline styles__ for user defined styles

<br />

#### Conclusions

When using Treat, we felt a lot like using CSS Modules: we need an external file for styles, we place the styles on the elements using `className`, we handle dynamic styles with __inline styles__, etc. However, we don't write CSS, and the overall experience with TypeScript support is magnificent, because everything is typed, so we don't do any __copy-paste__. Error messages are very helpful in guiding us when we do something we're not supposed to do. It's also the only analyzed solution the __extracts styles as `.css` files__ at built time, which should greatly improve the page load metrics.

The only thing to look out for is the limitation regarding dynamic styling. In highly interactive UIs that require user input styling, we'll have to use inline styles.

Treat is built with restrictions in mind, with a strong user-centric focus, balacing the developer experience with solid TypeScript support. It's also worth mentioning that [Mark Dalgleish](https://twitter.com/markdalgleish), co-author of CSS Modules, works at Seek and he's also a contributor.

### TypeStyle

Minimal library, focused only on type-checking. It is framework agnostic, that's why it doesn't have a special API for handling dynamic styles. There are React wrappers available, but the typings feels a bit convoluted.

Version: __`2.1`__ | Maintained by [Basarat](https://twitter.com/basarat) | Launched in __2017__ | [View Docs](https://typestyle.github.io/) | ... [back to Overview](#overview)

<br />

- ✅ __Styles/Component co-location__
- ✅ __TypeScript support__
- ✅ __Context-aware code completion__
- 🟠 __Built-in Theming support__: uses TS `namespaces` to define theming, which is [not recommended](https://basarat.gitbook.io/typescript/project/namespaces) even by the author himself, or by TS core team member [Orta Therox](https://youtu.be/8qm49TyMUPI?t=1277).
- ❌ __No Atomic CSS__

- __Styles definition method(s)__
  - ❌ Tagged Templates
  - ✅ Style Objects

- __Styles nesting__
  - ✅ Contextual styles
  - ✅ Abitrary nesting

- __Styles apply method(s)__
  - ✅ `className`
  - ❌ `styled` component
  - ❌ `css` prop

- __Styles output__
  - ❌ `.css` file extraction
  - ✅ `<style>` tag injection

- 📈 __High Learning curve__: the API is simple, but it doesn't provide a lot of features, so we'll still need to do manual work and to re-adjust the way we'll author styles

<br />

#### Worth mentioning observations

- 😕 bundles nested styles even if they are not used in component
- 😕 it doesn't handle dynamic styles, so we have to use regular JS functions to compute styles
- 🤨 when composing styles, we'll have to manually add some internal typings
- 🤔 don't know how to split dynamic and static styles, so it's very easy to create duplicated generated code
- 😱 it creates a single `<style>` tag with all the styles, and replaces it on update, and apparently it doesn't use `insertRule()`, not even in production builds, which might be an important performance drawback in large & highly dynamic UIs

<br />

#### Conclusions

Overall TypeStyle seems a minimal library, relatively easy to adopt because we don't have to rewrite our components, thanks to the classic `className` approach. However we do have to rewrite our styles, because of the Style Object syntax. We didn't feel like writting CSS, so there is a learning curve we need to climb.

With Next.js or React in general we don't get much value out-of-the-box, so we still need to perform a lot of manual work. The external [react-typestyle](https://github.com/Malpaux/react-typestyle) binding doesn't support hooks, it seems to be an abandoned project and the typings are too convoluted to be considered an elegant solution.

### Fela

It appears to be a mature solution, with quite a number of users. The API is intuitive and very easy to use, great integration for React using hooks.

Version: __`11.5`__ | Maintained by [Robin Weser](https://twitter.com/robinweser) | Launched in __2016__ | [View Docs](https://fela.js.org/docs/) | ... [back to Overview](#overview)

<br />

- ✅ __Styles/Component co-location__
- ✅ __Built-in Theming support__
- ✅ __Atomic CSS__
- 🟠 __TypeScript support__: it exposes Flow types, which work ok, from our (limited) experience
- 🟠 __Context-aware code completion__: styles defined outside the component require explicit typing to get code completion

- __Styles definition method(s)__
  - 🟠 Tagged Templates
  - ✅ Style Objects

- __Styles nesting__
  - ✅ Contextual styles
  - ✅ Abitrary nesting

- __Styles apply method(s)__
  - ✅ `className`
  - ❌ `styled` component
  - ❌ `css` prop

- __Styles output__
  - ❌ `.css` file extraction
  - ✅ `<style>` tag injection

- 📉 __Low Learning curve__: the API is simple, considering that we're comfortable with React hooks

<br />

#### Other benefits

- 😌 easy and simple to use API, very intuitive
- 🥳 creates very short and atomic class names (like `a`, `b`, ...)
- 😎 it has a lot of plugins that can add many additional features (but will also increase bundle size)

<br />

#### Worth mentioning observations

- 😕 bundles nested styles even if they are not used in component
- 🤨 when defining styles outside the component, we have to explicitly add some internal typings to get code completion
- 🥺 there's no actual TS support and the maintainer considers it a [low priority](https://github.com/robinweser/fela/issues/590#issuecomment-409373362)
- 🤕 without TS support, we cannot get fully type-safe integration into Next.js + TS (there are [missing types from the definition file](https://twitter.com/pfeiffer_andrei/status/1349106486740475904))
- 🤔 the docs say it supports string based styles, but they are a second-class citizen and they seem to work only for global styles
- 😵 some information in the docs is spread on various pages, sometimes hard to find without a search feature, and the examples and use cases are not comprehensive

<br />

#### Conclusions

Fela looks to be a mature solution, with active development. It introduces 2 great features which we enjoyed a lot. The first one is the basic principle that _"Style as a Function of State"_ which makes working with dynamic styles feel super natural and integrates perfectly with React's mindset. The second is atomic CSS class names, which should potentially scale great when used in large applications.

The lack of TS support however is a bummer, considering we're looking for a fully type-safe solution. Also, the scaling benefits of atomic CSS should be measured against the library bundle size.

### Stitches

Very young library, probably the most solid, modern and well-thought-out solution. The overall experience is just great, full TS support, a lot of other useful features baked in the lib.

Version: __`0.0.2`__ | Maintained by [Modulz](https://github.com/modulz) | Launched in __2020__ | [View Docs](https://stitches.dev/docs) | ... [back to Overview](#overview)

<br />

- ✅ __Styles/Component co-location__
- ✅ __TypeScript support__
- ✅ __Context-aware code completion__
- ✅ __Built-in Theming support__
- ✅ __Atomic CSS__

- __Styles definition method(s)__
  - ❌ Tagged Templates
  - ✅ Style Objects

- __Styles nesting__
  - ✅ Contextual styles
  - ✅ Abitrary nesting

- __Styles apply method(s)__
  - ✅ `className`
  - ✅ `styled` component
  - ✅ `css` prop _(used only to override `styled` components)_

- __Styles output__
  - ❌ `.css` file extraction
  - ✅ `<style>` tag injection

- 📉 __Low Learning curve__: the API is simple and intuitive, documentation is top-notch

<br />

#### Other benefits

- 😌 easy and simple to use API, a pleasure to work with
- 😎 great design tokens management and usage
- 🥰 documentation is exactly what we'd expect: no more, no less

<br />

#### Worth mentioning observations

- 😕 bundles nested styles even if they are not used in component
- 😵 uses `insertRule()` in development also, so we cannot see what gets bundled
- 🤨 it expands short-hand properties, from `padding: 1em;` will become `padding-top: 1em; padding-right: 1em; padding-bottom: 1em; padding-left: 1em;`
- 🤔 dynamic styles can be defined either using built-in `variants` (for predefined styles), or styles created inside the component to get access to the `props`
- 🧐 would help a lot to get the search feature inside the docs

<br />

#### Conclusions

Stitches is probably the most modern solution to this date, with full out-of-the-box support for TS. Without a doubt, they took some of the best features from other solutions and put them together for an awesome development experience. The first thing that impressed us was definitely the documentation. The second, is the API they expose which is close to top-notch. The features they provide are not huge in quantity, but are very well-thought-out.

However, we cannot ignore the fact that it's still in beta. Also, the authors identify it as "light-weight", but at __8 kB__ it's worth debating. Nevertheless, we will keep our eyes open and follow its growth.

### JSS

Probably the grandaddy around here, JSS is a very mature solution being the first of them, and still being maintained. The API is intuitive and very easy to use, great integration for React using hooks.

Version: __`10.5`__ | Maintained by [Oleg Isonen](https://twitter.com/oleg008) and [others](https://opencollective.com/jss#category-ABOUT) | Launched in __2016__ | [View Docs](https://cssinjs.org/) | ... [back to Overview](#overview)

<br />

- ✅ __Styles/Component co-location__
- ✅ __Built-in Theming support__
- ❌ __Atomic CSS__
- ❌ __TypeScript support__
- ❌ __Context-aware code completion__

- __Styles definition method(s)__
  - ❌ Tagged Templates
  - ✅ Style Objects

- __Styles nesting__
  - 🟠 Contextual styles: _(works for pseudo classes/elements, not for media queries)_
  - 🟠 Abitrary nesting: _(requires separate plugin)_

- __Styles apply method(s)__
  - ✅ `className`
  - 🟠 `styled` component (_see details below_)
  - ❌ `css` prop

- __Styles output__
  - ❌ `.css` file extraction
  - ✅ `<style>` tag injection

- 📉 __Low Learning curve__: the API is simple, considering that we're comfortable with React hooks

<br />

#### Other benefits

- 😌 easy and simple to use API, very intuitive
- 😎 it has a lot of plugins that can add many additional features (but will also increase bundle size)

<br />

#### Worth mentioning observations

- 😕 bundles nested styles even if they are not used in component
- 🤔 `react-jss` uses className by default. There's also `styled-jss` that uses __Styled Components__ approach, but it has no types, and couldn't make it work on top of `react-jss`.
- 😖 global styles are cumbersome to setup, requires plugin, tried to mix the JSS setup docs, with the `react-jss` SSR setup docs, with the `plugin-globals` docs on usage, without any luck

<br />

#### Conclusions

The API is similar in many ways to React Native StyleSheets, while the hooks helper allows for easy dynamic styles definition. There are many plugins that can add a lot of features to the core functionality, but attention must be payed to the total bundle size, which is significant even with the bare minimum only.

Also, being the first CSS-in-JS solution built, it lacks many of the modern features that focuses on developer experience.

### Goober

A really light-weight solution, not very popular, but with a load of features.

Version: __`2.0`__ | Maintained by [Cristian Bote](https://twitter.com/cristianbote_) | Launched in __2019__ | [View Docs](https://goober.js.org/) | ... [back to Overview](#overview)

<br />

- ✅ __Styles/Component co-location__
- ✅ __Built-in Theming support__
- ✅ __TypeScript support__
- ✅ __Context-aware code completion__
- ❌ __Atomic CSS__

- __Styles definition method(s)__
  - ✅ Tagged Templates
  - ✅ Style Objects

- __Styles nesting__
  - ✅ Contextual styles
  - ✅ Abitrary nesting

- __Styles apply method(s)__
  - ✅ `className`
  - ✅ `styled` component (_see details below_)
  - 🟠 `css` prop (_is supported, but requires a separate babel plugin_)

- __Styles output__
  - ❌ `.css` file extraction
  - ✅ `<style>` tag injection

- 📉 __Low Learning curve__: if you're using only the `css` API with `className`, it's a low learning curve

<br />

#### Other benefits

- 🤏 really tiny
- 😎 it supports a very wide range of defining styles, so it's pretty versatile and full featured in this regard (however, I fear that having all these options at your disposal, a large team would mix various ways if defining styles)

<br />

#### Worth mentioning observations

- 😕 bundles nested styles even if they are not used in component
- 🤫 for user input styles, it generates a new class name for each update, but it does NOT remove the old ones, appending indefinitely to the DOM
- 🤔 don't know how to split static and dynamic styles, resulting in highly polluted duplicated styles in head for component variants
- 😱 it creates a single `<style>` tag with all the styles, and appends to it on update, and apparently it doesn't use `insertRule()`, not even in production builds, which might be an important performance drawback in large & highly dynamic UIs

<br />

#### Conclusions

Looking at Goober you cannot ask yourself what kind of magic did Cristian Bote do to fit all the features inside this tiny library. It is really mind blowing. It is marketed as being _"less than 1KB"_, which is not entirely accurate, but still... it's the smallest library we've tested.

## Disregarded solutions


### Aphrodite

It's not a popular solution, the approach is similar to **React Native StyleSheets**  way of styling components. Has built-in TypeScript support and a simple API.

- global styles are a bit cumbersome to define
- able to nest media queries & pseudo selectors, but cannot nest arbitrary rules/selectors
- no dynamic out-of-the-box support, so you have to get around that, like inline styles I guess, or like in React Native
- doesn't add any real value, except the ergonomics to colocate styles with the component.

### Glamor

I got it started with Next.js, but it feels fragile. The [Glamor official example](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-glamor) throws an error regarding `rehydrate`. When commenting it out, it works, but not sure what the consequences are.

- it looks like an unmaintained or abandoned package
- documentation is pretty minimal
- lacks any TS support
- has a lot of documented experimental features, marked as "buggy"
- it feels like a side/internal project at FB, that is not used anymore.

### Linaria

Didn't manage to start it with Next.js + TypeScript.

It was an interesting solution, as it promises zero-runtime overhead, generating `.css` files at build time, while the style are collocated within the components.

### Cxs

Didn't manage to start it with Next.js + TypeScript. The [official example](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-cxs) uses version 3, while today we have version 6. The example doesn't work, because the API has changed.

The solution looked interesting, because it is supposed to be very light-weight.

### Astroturf

Didn't manage to start it with Next.js + TypeScript. The [official example](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-astroturf) uses an older version of Next.js.

The solution is not that popular, but it was the first to use `.css` extraction with collocated styles.

### Otion

Looks promising, atomic css and light-weight. It has a working [Next.js example](https://github.com/kripod/otion/tree/main/packages/example-nextjs), but we didn't consider it because it lacks any documentation.

### Styletron

It looks like a not so popular solution, which also lacks support for TypeScript. It looks like the maintainers work at Uber and they use it internally. It focused on generating unique atomic CSS classes, which could potentially deduplicate a lot of code.

### Radium

The project was put in [Maintenance Mode](https://formidable.com/blog/2019/radium-maintenance/). They recommend other solutions.

### Glamorous

The project was [discontinued](https://github.com/paypal/glamorous/issues/419) in favor of Emotion.

<br />

## Running the examples

Each implementation sits on their own branch, so we can have a clear separation at built time.

```bash
# install dependencies
yarn

# for development
yarn dev

# for production
yarn build
yarn start
```
